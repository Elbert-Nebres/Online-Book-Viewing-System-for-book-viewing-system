Instructions for Setting up AVAILABOOKS:
System Requirements:
Local Server Environment:

Install WampServer or XAMPP on your computer.
Database Management:

Make sure PHPMyAdmin is included with your WampServer/XAMPP installation.
Setup Steps:
Download Files from GitHub:

Visit the GitHub repository for AVAILABOOKS.
Download the project files (usually a ZIP file).
Import Database to PHPMyAdmin:

Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
Locate a database file (usually with a .sql extension) within the extracted files.
Open PHPMyAdmin in your web browser (usually http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
Create a new database (if not already created).
Select the new database and choose the "Import" option.
Upload the .sql file to import the database structure and data.
Place Files in Local Server Directory:

Navigate to the directory where you installed WampServer ({WampInstallationFolder}/www/) or XAMPP ({XamppInstallationFolder}/htdocs/).
Copy all files from the extracted GitHub ZIP into this directory.
Run the Local Server:

Start WampServer or XAMPP.
Open your web browser and type http://localhost/{yourFileName} (replace {yourFileName} with the actual name of the file you want to run).
Access the Application:

The AVAILABOOKS application should now be accessible in your web browser.
Important Notes:
Ensure that your local server (WampServer/XAMPP) is running before trying to access the application.
Make sure to use the correct file name in the URL when accessing the application.
